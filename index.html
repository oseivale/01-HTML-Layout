            <h2>Order Out of Chaos: Patterns of Organization for Writing on the Job</h2>

            <h3>by Richard Rabil, Jr. · 2 Comments</h3>

            <p>The meaning of what you write isn’t only the the words.
              The sequence of information, the categories you use, the
              emphasis you imply through your hierarchy—all of these decisions
              have a huge influence on audience understanding. Richard Rabil,
              Jr., explains how to use foundational patterns of organization to
              help you convey what you mean to say.

            <h3>participants Jen Simmons, Roger Black, Jeffrey Zeldman</h3>

            <p>Can typography encourage long-form reading—not just scanning? What are the most
              exciting areas of cutting-edge experimentation in typographic technology and digital
              layout, and what new skills will we need to design tomorrow’s web content?
              Three experts—Mozilla’s Jen Simmons, publication design legend Roger Black, and ALA’s
              Jeffrey Zeldman—discuss typography and layout on today’s web: where we are now, and
              where we’re going.
